    <p>You're not currently a member of London Hackspace. To become a member, we ask that you pay what you
       think the space is worth to you. Running an organisation like this in London isn't cheap, so please be as
       generous as you can. The minimum subscription is £5/month.</p>

<h3>Standing Order</h3>
    <p>Set up a monthly standing order with your bank (most banks let you do this online),
       using the following details. Please make sure you enter the reference provided in the
       reference field of your payment, or your subscription will not be recognised.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Bank</th>
        <td>Barclays</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Payee</th>
        <td>London Hackspace Ltd.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Sort Code</th>
        <td>20-32-06</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Account Number</th>
        <td>53413292</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Reference</th>
        <td><?=$user->getMemberNumber()?></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Don't worry if the name doesn't fit in full.</p>

    <p>Once the payment has left your account, it can take up to four working days to be reflected here.</p>

<h3>Can't do Standing Order?</h3>
<p>In our experience standing order is an almost universal payment method in the UK.
   It's the only method which is completely free for both you and us. Consequently, we don't accept
   payment for membership by any other method.</p>

<p> If you genuinely aren't able to use a standing
    order to pay, please drop <a href="mailto:russ@hackspace.org.uk">Russ</a> an email to let us
    know why.</p>
