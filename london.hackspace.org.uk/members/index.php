<h3>Standing Order</h3>
    <p>Set up a monthly standing order with your bank (most banks let you do this online),
       using the following details.</p>

    <p><strong>Please carefully check that you have entered the reference provided in the
       reference field of your payment</strong>. Your payment is processed automatically,
        and that can't happen without the correct reference.</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Bank</th>
        <td>Barclays</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Payee</th>
        <td>London Hackspace Ltd.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Sort Code</th>
        <td>20-32-06</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Account Number</th>
        <td>53413292</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Reference</th>
        <td style="font-family:monospace"><?=$user->getMemberNumber()?></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Don't worry if the name doesn't fit in full.</p>

    <p>Once the payment has left your account, it can take up to four working days to be reflected here.</p>

<h3>Can't do Standing Order?</h3>

  <p>Currently, the only way to be recognised as a member is for your membership payment to appear in our bank account
      with the correct payment reference. If you can't do this by standing order, you can send a one-off
      bank transfer with the same details, or bring these details to any Barclays branch and pay in cash.
      Please make sure that the reference is correct; bank cashiers frequently get it wrong.</p>

<h3>Tell us about yourself</h3>

<p>While you're waiting for your payment to process, why don't you tell us a bit about yourself? <a href="/members/profile_edit.php">Create a profile</a> to help other members get to know you better. When your payment has been received you'll be able to see other member's profiles too.

<h3>Any problems?</h3>
   <p>If you have any problems paying, please contact 
      <a href="mailto:membership@london.hackspace.org.uk">membership@london.hackspace.org.uk</a>.</p>
