This is the source code for the [London Hackspace web site](https://london.hackspace.org.uk)

## Getting Started

We use Vagrant to deploy a consistent development environment. To get
your development environment set up:

* Clone this repo
* Fetch libraries: `git submodule update --init`
* Create config file (the defaults are fine): `cp etc/config.php.example etc/config.php`
* Create production settings file (the defaults are fine): `cp lhs/production_settings.py.example lhs/production_settings.py`
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Run `vagrant up` in this directory. This will create and configure a virtual machine.

You should now be able to connect to http://localhost:8000 to view your
development site. Changes you make on your machine will be reflected
on the VM.

If you need to log into the VM for any reason, you can just run
`vagrant ssh`. To access the postgres database, run `psql
hackspace` from the SSH shell.

## Making yourself an admin
In the postgres shell:

    hackspace=# update users set subscribed=True;
    hackspace=# update users set admin=True;

to make yourself a member and an admin

## letting apache add ldap users (!)
use visudo to add this:

    www-data ALL=(www-data:ldapadmin) NOPASSWD:NOSETENV: /var/www/hackspace-foundation-sites/bin/ldap-add.sh, /var/www/hackspace-foundation-sites/bin/ldap-delete.sh

and then:

    groupadd ldapadmin
    chgrp ldapadmin /etc/smbldap-tools/smbldap_bind.conf
    chmod 0640 /etc/smbldap-tools/smbldap_bind.conf

## Enabling Calendar management
1. Enable the Calendar API at https://console.developers.google.com/.../apiui/api
2. Create a service account for OAuth at https://console.developers.google.com/.../apiui/credential
3. Put the OAuth certificate in ./var, and correct the service_account_name and key_file_location in lib/calendar.php
4. Go to the Hackspace calendar on Google and share it with the same service_account_name address

API documentation https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/


## Upgrading from PHP

Add to cron:

    0 4 * * *  www-data  /var/www/hackspace-foundation-sites/manage.sh clearsessions

After setting the credentials appropriately and taking a backup, run:

    env/bin/python manage.py migrate main 0001 --fake-initial
    env/bin/python manage.py migrate sites
    env/bin/python manage.py migrate

And then run in the following SQL files:

 - etc/create-flourish-tables.sql
 - etc/restore-column-defaults.sql
 - etc/restore-multicolumn-pks.sql

And don't forget to run:

    env/bin/python manage.py collectstatic

after each deployment.


## Running under docker

This is a work-in-progress, but likely to take over from Vagrant quickly.

    docker-compose up

To clear out the database and PHP sessions:

    docker-compose down -v

To access the DB:

    docker-compose exec db psql postgres://hackspace:hackspace@db/hackspace
