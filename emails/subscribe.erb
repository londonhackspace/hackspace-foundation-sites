Dear <%=name%>,

This email is to confirm that we've received your payment and your London
Hackspace membership is now active. We're very grateful for your support!

Note that although open & operational we are still busy setting up more things in the new space. 
As you are aware we are all volunteers and it will be very much appreciated if you can offer your help.

We recommend that you join our Discord server in order to keep up to date
with the goings-on at London Hackspace: https://discord.gg/VPqdVsqFX5

You can also use also our mailing list:
  http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Mailing_List

To get 24-hour access, firstly you'll need to attend a space induction.
These are most often held on Wednesday evenings, although occasionally on other days & times.
Check or ask in the 'induction-requests' channel on our Discord server.

You will also need to register your Oyster card (or other
similar RFID card). The easiest way to do this is before or after the space induction, or if you miss that opportunity you can ask on Discord.

Before you start using the space, you should make sure that you're familiar
with our rules:

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
