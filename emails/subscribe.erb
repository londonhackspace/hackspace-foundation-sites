Dear <%=name%>,

This email is to confirm that we've received your payment and your London
Hackspace membership is now active. We're very grateful for your support!

Before you start using the space, you should make sure that you're familiar
with our rules:

We also recommend that you join our mailing list in order to keep up to date
with the goings-on at London Hackspace:

To get 24-hour access, you'll need to register your Oyster card (or other
similar RFID card). The easiest way to do this is to visit the space and ask a
friendly member to help you add your card. The code for the back gate padlock 
can be found in the members section at https://london.hackspace.org.uk/members/code.php

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
