Dear <%=name%>,

This email is to confirm that we've received your payment and your London
Hackspace membership is now active. We're very grateful for your support!

Note that we are currently closed (and busy setting up in our new space), apart from occasional members sessions (details of which are posted to the Discord). We hope to have the space fully operational soon at which point we will send instructions for registering your access card and getting site inducted.

We also recommend that you join our Discord server in order to keep up to date
with the goings-on at London Hackspace: https://discord.gg/VPqdVsqFX5

You can also use also our mailing list:

To get 24-hour access once access control has been installed, you'll need to register your Oyster card (or other
similar RFID card). The easiest way to do this is to visit the space during a
busy time (Tuesdays or weekends) and ask a friendly member to help you add
your card.

Before you start using the space, you should make sure that you're familiar
with our rules:

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
