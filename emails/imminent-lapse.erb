Dear <%=name%>,

This is an automated email sent from the Hackspace payment system.

Our records show no membership payments from you in over a month. As a
result, your membership will be suspended automatically if you don't 
make a payment within the next two days.

We last received a payment from you on <%=date%>.

If you believe this is a mistake, please reply to this email with the 
date, amount, and reference of your most recent payment, and we'll look 
into it.

If you've changed bank account or want to confirm our payment details 
and your reference you can find them on our web site:

https://london.hackspace.org.uk/members/

Alternatively if you are cancelling your membership we'd be very 
interested to hear any feedback you have about why you've cancelled your 
membership, or how we can improve London Hackspace - just hit reply and 
let us know.

If you're still storing anything in the space, please arrange to remove 
it as soon as possible, otherwise we will have to dispose of it to free 
up space for other members to use.

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
