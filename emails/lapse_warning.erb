Dear <%=name%>,

This is an automated email sent from our payment system.

We haven't noticed a payment from you in over a month, and if we
do not within 7 days your membership will be automatically suspended, and your
door access will be disabled.

We last received a payment from you on <%=date%>.

If you believe we are warning you in error, please reply to this
email with the date, amount, and reference of your most recent payment,
and we'll look into it.

If you've changed bank account or want to confirm our payment details and
your reference you can find them on our web site:

https://london.hackspace.org.uk/members/

Alternatively if you are cancelling your membership we'd be very
interested to hear any feedback you have about why you've cancelled your
membership, or how we can improve London Hackspace - just hit reply and
let us know.

If you're still storing anything in the space, please arrange to remove
it as soon as possible, otherwise we will have to dispose of it to free
up space for other members to use.

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
